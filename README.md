## Realistic Physics simulation of the Domino effect

#### using Nvidia PhysX SDK v3.4.0

##### This project aimed to create a realistic physics simulation of a domino show where each domino is falls from the force of the previous domino ( domino effect). The trigger for the first domino to fall is handled by the user by either pressing (x) to release a hammer to knock the domino or using the arror keys to move a ball with force to hit the domino.

##### Languages **C++**, **C** and the **Nvidia PhysX** SDK are used

##### Challenges faced in this project: 
- Creating Compound Objects
- Creating axis and revolut Joints for motion
- Simulating real world physics

## Realistic Physics simulation of the Domino effect

#### using Nvidia PhysX SDK

This project aimed to create a realistic physics simulation of a domino show where each domino falls from the force of the previous domino (the domino effect).
The trigger for the first domino to fall is handled by the user by either pressing (x) to release a hammer to knock the domino or using the arror keys to move a ball with force to hit the domino.

Languages **C++**, **C** and the **Nvidia PhysX** SDK are used

##### Challenges faced in this project: 
- Creating Compound Objects
- Creating axis and revolut Joints for motion
- Simulating real world physics
